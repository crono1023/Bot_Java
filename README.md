# Bot_Java
Simple IRC bot written in Java

This project is being created for educational purposes. Creating an IRC bot is a good way to practice working with strings and learning the basics of socket programming. While the last few IRC bot's I have worked on were in Python or .NET, I'm really liking working with Java so far. Being able to work on the code and run it in Linux as well as Windows is an added bonus. Java's syntax isn't too far from that of C++ which is probably the reason I'm fond of Java and a nice break from the chaos of a weak typed language like Python.
